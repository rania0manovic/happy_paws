## Installation
### Starting the API with docker

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Wait approximately two minutes after all containers are up for Kafka to finish initialization (init-kafka container will exit once it's done). After this, the server side is ready to use.

### Starting the flutter app
Depending on your preference, the mobile app can be run on either an emulator or a real device. The current code is set for an emulator. For the real device setup, you might need to use additional tools like ngrok to redirect traffic from your device to the local machine.
